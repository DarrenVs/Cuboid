### Master
The live/current version of the game. Should not be used for testing nor contain known bugs.
### Hotfix
A sub branch for Master if there needs to be a quick fix against exploits or major bug fixes.
### Development
The main development branch. This brach contains the latest playable build.
### Feature
The new features branch. This branch will act as the testing branch and to merge, apply and test new features on.
## Commit version control
For easy tracking of sprints, days, and commits, we will track this within the commit's name by writing the version within it.
### Example:
**Breakdown:** Commit_1.2.3
 1. Current sprint
 2. Day of the week in number
 3. Commit number in that branch
